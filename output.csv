The data was developed based on a horizontal projection/datum of NAD83 (2011) State Plane Pennsylvania South Zone, US survey feet; NAVD1988 (Geoid 12B), US survey feet. LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 711 individual 5,000-foot x 5,000-foot tiles. Tile names use the following naming schema: ""YYYYXXXXPAd"" where YYYY is the first 3 characters of the tile\'s upper left corner Y-coordinate, XXXX - the first 4 characters of the tile\'s upper left corner X-coordinate, PA = Pennsylvania, and d = \'N\' for North or \'S\' for South.

They are made available on the Map Service Center for these purposes. Letters of Map Change (LOMC) that were issued to amend Historic Products when they were still effective are also listed here.

Full FIRM panels are quite large (36\' x 25.875\'), so most users will prefer to print out a smaller selected portion called a FIRMette.

Montgomery County Planning Commission provided in-kind funding for the project as well as completing the assessment portion in Montgomery Count. Heritage Conservancy completed the assessment for the areas in Bucks County and Philadelphia County. Both organizations then mapped waterways lacking riparian forest buffers. The assessment included the main stem, tributaries and small headwater streams. The 1' pixel resolution 2010 aerials from DVRPC served as the basis for the riparian conditions along the waterways. The forest buffer conditions were classified and digitized into a Geographic Information System (GIS). This dataset is an assessment of the same area completed back in 200-2004. The same methodology of creating 50 foot buffers from the edge of water to assess the tree cover in this area was used. The stream centerline is used to represent the classification of whether one side, both sides, or neither side has tree cover.

Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added.  Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile.  The canopy coverage percentage was interpreted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement.  At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none).  \r\n\r\n   - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream.\r\n   - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.\r\n   - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.\r\n\r\nThe threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft.  If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines.  Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline.  In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides.\r\n\r\nPonds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis.  Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value.  \r\n\r\nEdits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious.  The point of this analysis was not to delineate new stream lines, but rather to give existing streamlines riparian buffer attributes.  The large majority of the segments are identical to the original Berks County Planning Commission streamlines.  \r\n\r\nStream and shorelines were cut into segments based on the riparian attribute value.  \r\n\r\nTen sites were chosen for on-site verification and they were visited in July 2007.',)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=Heritage_BerksRiparianStreams2007.xml',)"

Street Centerlines are classified as Primary Road, Secondary Road, Unpaved Road, Limited Access Road, Connecting Road, Jeep Trail, Walkway, Stairway, Alleyway and Unknown.\r\n\r\nA Primary Road is a street paved with either concrete or asphalt that has two (2) or more lanes in each direction.  A Secondary Road is a residential type hard surface road, or any hard surface road with only one (1) lane in each direction.  An Unpaved Road is any road covered with packed dirt or gravel.  A Limited Access Road is one that can only be accessed from a Connecting Road such as an Interstate Highway.  A Connecting Road is a ramp connecting a Limited Access Road to a surface street.  A Walkway is a paved or unpaved foot track that connects two (2) roads together.  Walkways within College Campuses will also be shown.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  Walkways will not have an Edge of Pavement feature.  A Stairway is a paved or wooden structure that connects two (2) roads together.  Recreational pedestrian trails and walkways through parks and wooded areas are not considered transportation and will not be digitized during this update.  An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than a Secondary Road that runs between, but parallel to, two (2) Secondary Roads.  Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways.  A Jeep Trail is a vehicular trail used for recreation.  A Jeep Trail will not have an associated edge of pavement feature.  A road coded as Unknown is a road, which in the judgment of the photogrammetrist, does not fall into any of the categories listed.\r\n\r\nCenterlines will be visually placed between the edges of pavement.  One (1) centerline will be placed between each edge of pavement.  Roads with medial strips, such as Limited Access Roads, will have two (2) centerlines for those portions of the road where the medial strip is present.\r\n\r\nFor roads that terminate with a cul-de-sac, the centerline shall continue through the center of the cul-de-sac and stop at the edge of pavement.\r\n\r\nAll attribute data will remain for all Street Centerlines that are not updated.  For Street Centerlines that are new, the only attribute field that will be populated is the FeatureCode and UPDATE_YEAR.  If a Street Centerline is graphically modified, the existing attribute data will remain and the UPDATE_YEAR will be set to 2004.  The attribute values for 2004 Street Centerlines should be considered suspicious until verified.\r\n\r\nThe ArcInfo Street Centerline coverage that is being updated has 800 segments of Paper Streets, 66 segments of Vacated Streets and 78 segments of Steps.  Street Centerlines that are coded as Paper Streets in the OWNER field will remain unchanged in the updated dataset unless the area has been developed.  In the event the area has been developed, the Street Centerlines will be modified to reflect the true condition of the visible roads.\r\nStreet Centerlines that are coded as Vacated in the OWNER field will also remain unchanged in the updated dataset.  In the event the area coinciding with the Vacated Streets has been developed, the Vacated Street Centerlines will be removed in order to reflect the true condition of the area.\r\n\r\nStreet Centerlines that are coded as Steps in the OWNER field will be updated to reflect the current condition of the area.\r\n\r\nThe Street Centerlines dataset consists of an external table that links to the supplied coverages and the Geodatabase created for this project using the ""-ID"" (UserID) field.  In order to maintain the link to the external table and not loose valuable data the decision was made to keep all database information currently in the Street Centerline dataset.  When a Street Centerline is modified during the update process, the field ""UPDATE_YEAR"" is set to 2004.  All other database attributes will remain unchanged from the original values.  All Street Centerline database data with an ""UPDATE_YEAR"" of 2004 should be verified before used.  In some occasions the Street Centerline was divided into two (2) sections to allow for a new road intersection.  Both sections of the resulting Street Centerline will have the same database attributes including Address Range.

Roads that have been tarred and chipped are also considered paved.  Roads surfaced with gravel or packed dirt are considered Unpaved.  An Alleyway is a road, usually narrower than surrounding roads that runs between, but parallel to, two paved roads.  An Alley can be either paved or unpaved.  Generally, Outbuildings will be adjacent to Alleyways.  Road pavement edges that are underneath bridges or overpasses are coded as Hidden.  Bridges and Overpasses are delineated along the outside edge of the structure.  Portions of bridges that are under other bridges or other objects are coded as Hidden Bridge.  Tunnels are shown as lines connecting the apparent width of the tunnel through the earth.  Stairways are major pedestrian thoroughfares, either paved or wooden, connecting two (2) roads and typically found on steep hills.  Airfield Runways are the edges of Runways, Taxiways and other airfield pavement areas.  Driveways that are greater than 300' in length will be digitized and coded as either Paved Road or Unpaved Road.\r\n\r\nPaved Road edges show the width of the paved area.  If the paved road has a paved shoulder, the paved shoulder is shown as part of the paved road.  The placement of an unpaved road is subject to interpretation by the photogrammetrist since the road edge may be indefinite due to the imprecise nature of an unpaved surface.\r\n\r\nDriveways that are over 300' in length are digitized.  For a driveway that terminates at a building, it shall be drawn to the building.  Driveways will also have a centerline for its entire length.\r\n\r\nParking lots are not digitized.  The entrance to a parking lot for shopping areas shall be shown.  Driving areas around and through parking lots serving shopping areas and other businesses are considered part of the parking lot.  If the driving area through a parking lot connects to two (2) or more exterior roads, the main thoroughfare through the parking lot shall be shown as a road.\r\n\r\nThe driving area through an apartment complex or condominium complex shall be digitized as a road.

All records are organized by the Atlas region. Various attributes of the Atlas block are incorporated, including geographic features (physiographic locations), effort (hours of fieldwork). The species segment, being replicated the full 320,000 times, was kept to a minimal size, and lists only the species and breeding code, the year and comment. Evidence of birds nesting within an Atlas block was recorded with a set of codes that describe behavior and physical evidence of nesting. These codes are divided into four hierarchical categories, three of which indicate breeding. ""Observed,"" ""Possible,"" ""Probable,"" and ""Confirmed"" breeding codes represent increasing evidence that nesting occurred within the block a species was recorded. ""Probable"" and ""Confirmed"" categories were further segregated into hierarchical codes that represent individual breeding behaviors or physical evidence of nesting. A description of breeding codes may be provided upon request. All of Pennsylvania\'s 4,928 atlas ""blocks"" were surveyed, with an average of 65 species per block recorded.

More than two thousand dedicated birdwatchers completed surveys of birds across the state from 2004 to 2009. The data amassed reveal the distribution of each species and show changes in distribution since the publication of the first Atlas. The core results of the project are the distribution maps. In fact, up to three maps per species show in fine detail the current distribution of all breeding birds based on the second Atlas, changes in distribution since the first Atlas, and, for more than one hundred species, their density across Pennsylvania.The field project was based at Powdermill Nature Reserve, environmental research center of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Rector, Pennsylvania. Bob Mulvihill and Mike Lanzone were project co-coordinators. Following the recommendations of the North American Ornithological Atlas Committee, the basic survey unit was the \u201cblock,\u201d defined as one-sixth of a standard U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute topographic map, of which 4,937 were identified for survey coverage. Local coordination was provided by volunteer Regional Coordinators, who provided the foundation for organizing fieldwork. Eventually, 83 individuals served as Regional Coordinators (see the list under the Credits tab).Breeding bird atlases employ a set of codes to record the behaviors associated with nesting activity, ranging from the simplest detection by sight or sound, through confirmation of active nests and fledged young. Birds observed in breeding habitat, and within their particular breeding season, were placed in one of four categories based on breeding evidence \u2014 observations outside breeding habitat, or Possible, Probable, or Confirmed breeding \u2014 with a two-letter code used for confirmed breeding evidence and single letter codes for all other categories (See Project Methods \u2013 Breeding Codes). The second Atlas did not recommend undue effort to confirm breeding of common species, because it was believed that the field time could be better spent compiling species lists from multiple blocks. Obtaining confirmed breeding evidence was stressed for species identified in a particular conservation or priority category or for species simply rare or unexpected within the block.',)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PABBA_2nd.xml',)"

The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line File is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Block Groups (BGs) are defined before tabulation block delineation and numbering, but are clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their 4-digit census block number from the same decennial census. For example, Census 2000 tabulation blocks 3001, 3002, 3003,.., 3999 within Census 2000 tract 1210.02 are also within BG 3 within that census tract. Census 2000 BGs generally contained between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people. Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP). The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where the PSAP participant declined to delineate BGs or where the Census Bureau could not identify any local PSAP participant. A BG usually covers a contiguous area. Each census tract contains at least one BG, and BGs are uniquely numbered within census tract. Within the standard census geographic hierarchy, BGs never cross county or census tract boundaries, but may cross the boundaries of other geographic entities like county subdivisions, places, urban areas, voting districts, congressional districts, and American Indian / Alaska Native / Native Hawaiian areas. BGs have a valid code range of 0 through 9. BGs coded 0 were intended to only include water area, no land area, and they are generally in territorial seas, coastal water, and Great Lakes water areas. For Census 2000, rather than extending a census tract boundary into the Great Lakes or out to the U.S. nautical three-mile limit, the Census Bureau delineated some census tract boundaries along the shoreline or just offshore. The Census Bureau assigned a default census tract number of 0 and BG of 0 to these offshore, water-only areas not included in regularly numbered census tract areas. Some boundary details clarified by Philadelphia City Planning Commission May 2011"",)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=PhiladelphiaCensusBlockGroups201201.xml',)"

"(u'Philadelphia Census Tracts 2010',)","(u'2010',)","(u'City of Philadelphia',)","(u""Census tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical subdivisions of a county delineated by local participants as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The U.S. Census Bureau delineated census tracts in situations where no local participant existed or where local or tribal governments declined to participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable set of geographic units for the presentation of decennial census data. Census tracts generally have between 1,500 and 8,000 people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. Counties with fewer people have a single census tract.) When first delineated, census tracts are designed to be homogeneous with respect to population characteristics, economic status, and living conditions. The spatial size of census tracts varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over many decades so that statistical comparisons can be made from decennial census to decennial census. However, physical changes in street patterns caused by highway construction, new developments, and so forth, may require occasional boundary revisions. In addition, census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or combined as a result of substantial population decline.Census tracts are identified by a four-digit basic number and may have a two-digit numeric suffix; or example, 6059.02. The decimal point separating the four-digit basic tract number from the two-digit suffix is shown in the printed reports and on census maps. In computer-readable files, the decimal point is implied. Many census tracts do not have a suffix; in such cases, the suffix field is either left blank or is zero-filled. Leading zeros in a census tract number (for example, 002502) are shown only in computer-readable files. Census tract suffixes may range from .01 to .98. For the 1990 census, the .99 suffix was reserved for census tracts/block numbering areas (BNAs) that contained only crews-of-vessels population; for Census 2000, the crews-of-vessels population is part of the related census tract.Census tract numbers range from 1 to 9999 and are unique within a county or statistically equivalent entity. The U.S. Census Bureau reserves the basic census tract numbers 9400 to 9499 for census tracts delineated within or to encompass American Indian reservations and off-reservation trust lands that exist in multiple states or counties. The number 0000 in computer-readable files identifies a census tract delineated to provide complete coverage of water area in territorial seas and the Great Lakes.

Ancillary data sources included GIS data (building footprints, road polygons, and hydrography) provided by City of Philadelphia. This land cover dataset is considered current as of 2008. Object-based image analysis techniques (OBIA) were employed to extract land cover information using the best available remotely sensed and vector GIS datasets. OBIA systems work by grouping pixels into meaningful objects based on their spectral and spatial properties, while taking into account boundaries imposed by existing vector datasets.  Within the OBIA environment a rule-based expert system was designed to effectively mimic the process of manual image analysis by incorporating the elements of image interpretation (color/tone, texture, pattern, location, size, and shape) into the classification process.  A series of morphological procedures were employed to insure that the end product is both accurate and cartographically pleasing.

Purpose:\r\nThis dataset identifies the distribution of surficial unconsolidated sediments (glacial deposits and stream alluvium) in northwestern PA. This map is the only published comprehensive regional surficial geologic map available for the region. The original map was digitized to provide an electronic version for GIS work. Potential users should read the Supplemental Information Section (below) to determine the appropriate scale for using these data.

Next a 50 ft. buffer shapefile was derived from the streamlines and added.  Using the newly created buffer shapefile as a guide, visual analysis was done for entire shapefile.  The canopy coverage percentage was interpreted by Heritage Conservancy and buffer shapefile was used to define the 50 ft. distance requirement.  At a scale of 1:2,000, the streamlines were attributed with one of three riparian values (full, half, none).  \r\n\r\n   - Full Value: both banks of the stream contain 50% or greater canopy coverage for 50 ft from the stream.\r\n   - Half Value: only one bank of the stream contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.\r\n   - None Value: neither stream bank contains 50% or greater canopy coverage.\r\n\r\nThe threshold for determining whether or not a shoreline segment or a stream centerline segment should be used for the analysis was if the waterway was wider than 100 ft for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft.  If a waterway was wider than 100 ft. for a linear distance of approximately 400 ft., shorelines would be used rather than stream centerlines.  Having the threshold include a 400 ft linear distance requirement made many ponds be represented by a centerline rather than a shoreline.  In cases were the original data contained two shorelines to represent a stream that was not greater than 100 ft wide, a new centerline was created by Heritage Conservancy by using the orthophotos and the shorelines as guides.\r\n\r\nPonds that were delineated to represent headwaters were not included in this analysis.  Analysis and editing would begin at the tributary originating from the pond, but the pond itself would not be given a riparian value.  \r\n\r\nEdits to the shape of the streamline were done when they were visually obvious.  The point of this analysis was not to delineate new stream lines, but rather to give existing streamlines riparian buffer attributes.  The large majority of the segments are identical to the original Berks County Planning Commission streamlines.  \r\n\r\nStream and shorelines were cut into segments based on the riparian attribute value.  \r\n\r\nTen sites were chosen for on-site verification and they were visited in July 2007.',)","(u'FullMetadataDisplay.aspx?file=Heritage_BerksRiparianStreams2007.xml',)"

Loss indicates that tree canopy was removed from 2006 to 2011. Gain indicates that new tree canopy was established between 2006 and 2011.The method for producing this layer was based on the object fate analysis technique developed by Schopfer and Lang. The principal goal was to insure that estimates of tree canopy change were due to actual change and not due to differences in the 2006 and 2011 imagery. As such tree canopy mapping was done at the individual tree level. A combination of automated and manual techniques were employed using 2006 Quickbird imagery, 2008 LiDAR, and 2011 National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) data.
