      <abstract>This feature class was used to create maps, graphics, and inform analysis as part of the Philadelphia Trail Master Plan, adopted by the Planning Commission in July 2013. Please refer to the Philadelphia Trail Master Plan for further detail on the descriptions of the attributes described below. Inventory includes both existing trails and existing sidepaths, as defined below. Sidepaths are designated by the Streets Department with advisory approval from the Planning Commission, with the exception of sidepaths on Philadelphia Parks &amp; Recreation property. Data Development – The data was developed during the planning process based on close collaboration with Philadelphia Parks &amp; Recreation, Streets Department, and the Mayor’s Office of Transportation and Utilities. Data sources include the above mentioned and the Planning Commission. Alignments detailed here are not GPS calculated and are meant as guides to define approximate location and bounds of existing trails. Key Attributes Type 1= Trail or Sidepath. Categories are: Trail = Off road multi-purpose non-motorized right of way, typically wider than 8 feet. Sidepath = Off road multi-purpose non-motorized right of way, typically wider than 8 feet, functions are both sidewalk and multi-purpose trail.Trail Connector = Part of a trail that is a bridge, sidewalk, roadway crossing, driveway, or stairsOutside Philly Trail = Trails shown for regional context only. Material= The material of the trail or sidepath. Categories are: AsphaltConcrete DirtGravel WoodWidth= Where known, the width of the trail or sidepath. Typically only known for Philadelphia Park &amp; Recreation facilities. Where not know, value = 0. Name= Where designated, the official name of the trailEntity= Responsible party for trail operations and maintenance. Where applicable, two entities may be listed. Limits= Where known limits exist, they are listed here. For example, no bicycles allowed or not bikeable, under construction. Type 2: Categories are: Asphalt Trail Boardwalk BridgeBridge Trail Concrete Plaza Trail Dirt Trail Driveway Gravel Trail Parking LotRamp Road CrossingSidewalk StairsType 3= The Categories are: Designated - a trail or sidepath with a name or part of a larger system Not Designated – a trail or sidepath without a namePaved= Paved or not pavedLength= Length of the trail in feet. This is a GIS calculated length, not calculated by survey or GPS.</abstract>
