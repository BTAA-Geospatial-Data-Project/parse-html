This map is the only published comprehensive regional surficial geologic map available for the region. The original map was digitized to provide an electronic version for GIS work. Potential users should read the Supplemental Information Section (below) to determine the appropriate scale for using these data. More detailed surficial geologic maps may exist within the mapped area in either paper or electronic format. Researchers are encouraged to check with the U.S. Geological Survey, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey, PASDA, and/or Geology Departments at local universities and colleges for other maps.  aThis data set is not intended to be used for detailed or site-specific analyses, nor are they intended to be used at any scale finer than 1:125,000 (for example, use at 1:24,000 scale is inappropriate).  apublication date.  avector digital data.  aNone.  aThe published glacial deposits map (Shepps et al., 1959) is the basis for the polygon attributes. Allegheny College visually compared assigned attributes against the published source map. Based on this review, the attributes are believed to be accurate.dComplete chain-node topology is present. The data set was checked for polygon closure, erroneous or duplicate arcs, incorrect intersections, overshoots and undershoots, label errors, and node errors.eThe data set represents regional surficial geology of northwestern Pennsylvania. Contacts between lithologic units and attributes have been assigned to represent the published glacial deposits map (Shepps et al., 1959). No changes or updates have been made in the compilation process.fThe horizontal positional accuracy of the data set is that of the 1959 "Map of the Glacial Deposits of Northwestern Pennsylvania", which was compiled and published at a scale of 1:125,000. The base map on which the 1959 map was compiled was derived from U.S. Geologic Survey topographic quadrangles. No scale for the topographic base map was provided by Shepps et al., 1959.  aDigitized regional surficial geology map for northwestern Pennsylvania. The complete citation for the paper map is: Map of the Glacial Deposits of Northwestern Pennsylvania by V.C. Shepps, J.B. Droste, and R.F. Sitler under the supervision of G.W.White, 1959, Bulletin G-32, Pennsylvania Geologic Survey. The original map was published at a scale of 1:125,000. Three counties are fully covered by these deposits and mapped (Crawford, Erie, and Mercer); five more are partially covered and mapped (Beaver, Butler, Lawrence, Warren, and Venango). This GIS dataset shows the areal distribution of 14 distinct glacial deposits from the Pleistocene Epoch and Recent stream alluvium and/or bedrock exposures. All mapping activity and lithologic interpretations were made by the original authors of the map (Shepps et al., 1959); the authors of this electronic geospatial resource (Shaffer et al., 2005) have only provided digital transfer of the map features and attributes and documentation of the process.  aMicrosoft Windows XP Version 5.1 (Build 2600) Service Pack 3; ESRI ArcCatalog 9.3.1.3000.  cFIDdInternal feature number., ESRI 7ageology.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7asurficial.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aglacial.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7asediment.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ageologic.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7amoraine.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7atill.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aoutwash.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aalluvium.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7akame.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7aesker.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 7ageoscientificinformation.2ISO 19115 Topic Categories 0aPennsylvania. 0aBeaver. 0aButler. 0aCrawford. 0aErie. 0aForest. 0aLawrence. 0aMercer. 0aVenango. 0aWarren. 0aAppalachian Plateau.  aQuaternary40zConnect to this dataset online.uhttp://www.pasda.psu.edu/
