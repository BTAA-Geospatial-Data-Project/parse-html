			<abstract>In an effort to expedite the permit review process for Water
Obstruction and Encroachment Applications, the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection has initiated a plan to replace hard-copy maps
with digital GIS sets. The project is referred to as the 105 Spatial Data
System /8105SDS/9
Pennsylvania river floodplains and coastal floodplains are two of many
spatial data sets that were used in the 105SDS project. As a result of work
completed by Law Environmental, Inc. on the statewide low-level radioactive
waste siting project, DEP received two coverages depicting river and
coastal floodplains. However, due to the process used in constructing these
data sets, there were many areas throughout the state in which floodplains
were not digitized. The primary purpose of this task was to complete the
digital floodplain mapping in these areas.</abstract>
			<purpose>INTENDED USE OF DATA; Created to do permit reviews for Water
Obstruction and Encroachment Applications.
LIMITATIONS OF DATA; Due to the nature of transferring the floodplains from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency maps to our plotted 1:24000 scale
maps this coverage should be considered to be the "best representation"
of the data but not as accurate as, for example, a map of Global
Positioning System's floodplain coordinates.</purpose>
			<supplinf>1. The Law Environmental coverage was brought into workstation ARC/INFO.
Plots were made using this coverage, Pennsylvania Department of
Transportation roads, streams and municipal boundaries. Each plot was 3
quadrangle sheets (7.5 minute by 7.5 minute) large at 1:24000 scale.
2. The Law Environmental coverage was then clipped into 8 regions (using
the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation county coverage as a
guideline) for manageability reasons. Then each region was copied to
single precision and exported (with the "n" option) and then
transferred for import into PC ARC/INFO.
3. The available Federal Emergency Management Agency Flood Insurance Rate
Map/Federal Hazard Boundary maps were used to transfer the remaining
floodplains onto the above mentioned plots and were then digitized directly
into the Law Environmental regional coverage.
4. Once digitizing was finished the coverages were exported and transfered
back to the workstation where they were imported, cleaned and then edited
(in ARCedit) to remove any dangles and any other digitizing errors.
Usually the coverages were cleaned again and if not cleaned then they were
built.
5. Labels were created (createlabels), and then the coverage was built
again.
6. The item maptype was added to the .pat file and the floodplains were
then coded with their corresponding code. Some minor editing was done at
this step such as removing boundaries between floodplains with the same
code. Maptype codes reflect the level of detail of the original source map
higher values mean more detail.
7. When each coverage was finished some quality measurements were done. The
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation streams were brought up in the
background to double check the floodplain accuracy.
8. Coverages were built again. When the top 4 regions were complete they
were joined together same with the bottom 4 regions. The coverages were
cleaned and the boundaries between the regions were removed as well as
making sure all the border floodplains matched.
9. When the top and bottom halves were finished the two were joined
together and the boundary running through the middle of the state was
removed. The coverage was built, and the command unsplit (ARCedit) was
run to remove pseudonodes. The command createlabels was run to update the
label-ids in the .pat file and then the coverage was built one last time.</supplinf>
