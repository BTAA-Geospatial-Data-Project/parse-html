"Airborne transient electromagnetic survey data, southwest Lake Michigan coast, April 2017","Airborne transient electromagnetic (TEM) method was used along the southwest shore of Lake Michigan to map thickness and distribution of the unconsolidated sand covering the beach and the near shore area (up to 1 km into the lake).  From Kenosha, WI to the Illinois-Indiana border, a total of 1049 line-km of TEM data were acquired.  Sand distribution and thickness was estimated from conversion of the resistivity values from TEM data into lithology.  Through resistivity to lithology conversion, we were also able to estimate thickness and distribution of clay (glacial sediments) and dolomite (bedrock) under the lake bed.  A brief description of the comparison of geophysical results to lithology is provided in:  Mwakanyamale, K.E., Brown, S.E., & Theuerkauf, E.J.

"Coastal Habitat Maps along Illinois Beach State Park, derived from aerial and drone imagery, 1939-2020","These habitat maps were created to identify and monitor coastal change along Illinois' Lake Michigan shoreline at Illinois Beach State Park. Habitat maps are provided for four study sites which the ISGS has monitored monthly since 2018 using drones.
 
The initial habitat boundaries are from the Illinois Natural Areas Inventory (INAI), provided in August 2018 by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Illinois Nature Preserves Commission, Illinois Endangered Species Protection Board, and the Natural Heritage Database. The INAI habitat surveys were conducted in 1976 for Sites 1-3; surveys for Site 4 were conducted between 2008-2011. The eastern bounds of the habitat maps, defined as the contact between vegetated habitat and Lake Michigan beach sediment, were digitized from historical aerial images (1939-2017) and modern drone images (2018-2020). The modern images were collected using an unoccupied aerial system (UAS) flown at Illinois Beach State Park under contract for the Illinois Department of Natural Resources Coastal Management Program. The historical aerial images were sourced from the Lake County, Illinois, Planning, Building, and Development Department.
 
The data is georeferenced to NAD83(1986) UTM Zone 16 North meters and vertical coordinates in NAVD88 meters. All activities were conducted according to Federal Aviation Administration regulations and under the Illinois Natures Preserve Commissions permit and Illinois Department of Natural Resources permission.",none,"DataSummaryThese habitat maps were created to identify and monitor coastal change along Illinois' Lake Michigan shoreline at Illinois Beach State Park.

Illinois Height Modernization (ILHMP): LiDAR Data,"***New****  Download LiDAR Data thru our new Web Application Viewer.  The Viewer allows users to zoom into an area of interest and then simply select LAS tiles to download.  ***** 
Historically, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data for Illinois have been mainly based on 5- to 10-foot contour data. Large-scale, digital topographic maps are most common; many data resources contain elevation information acquired in the 1920s and 1930s. DEM data collections are now being developed based on data with a contour resolution of 2 feet to 6 inches. A comparison between older data and newer high-resolution data shows remarkable improvement in recorded detail.
ILHMP has established data sharing agreements to archive and distribute elevation data for select Illinois counties. Data have been acquired using Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technology, in compliance with different contract specifications. Data are offered as originally deliver LAS tile or as the derivative product of DEM/DTM or DSM.

Data Definitions
Derivatives:
Datasets in ArcGrid format are available for selected Illinois counties. The original, classified LiDAR data point cloud has been processed to create a digital terrain model (DTM) and a digital surface model (DSM) for each county. Additionally, each county .zip file contains an associated shaded relief model, or ‘hillshade’, an ArcGIS v.10.1 .mxd file, and also ArcGrid pyramid files and statistics to facilitate display and analysis. This zip file includes the LiDAR data point cloud processed into created digital terrain models (DTM) and a digital surface models (DSM) for each county. Additionally, each county .zip file contains an associated shaded relief model, or ‘hillshade’, an ArcGIS v.10.1 .mxd file, and also ArcGrid pyramid files and statistics to facilitate display and analysis.
 Digital Surface Model (DSM)
 Digital Terrain Model (DTM)
 Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
 LAS Point Cloud
DSM: all returns Processing all returns in the classified point cloud that represent both the ground surface and aboveground features (buildings, roadways and overpasses, vegetation, etc.) produces a DSM. A DSM is commonly referred to as the ‘First Returns’ reflective surface model.
 
DTM: ground returns with hydrologic breaklines When only the ground returns in a classified point cloud are used, the resulting hydro-flattened grid of bare-earth elevations is a DTM. Also, lake surfaces are smoothed and stream courses are conditioned for downhill flow using breakline data. This subset of the processed returns from the airborne laser sensor represent the ground surface and is commonly referred to as the ‘Bare Earth’ point cloud.
 
DEM: ground returns without hydrologic breaklines When hydro-flattening is not imposed during processing of the ground returns, either because of missing or insufficient breakline data, the resulting Bare Earth elevation grid is classified as a DEM.
 
LAS The LAS file format is a public file format for viewing the LiDAR point cloud data.  Each data point is recorded with precise horizontal position, vertical elevation, and other attribute values. 
 
Metadata This is a file that describes the content, quality, condition, origin and other characteristics of the LiDAR data collection. The Metadata file also includes the appropriate citation to use when citing the Lidar data.
 
Tile Index This is a shapefile of the point cloud tile boundaries with tile name.  This file is helpful to view if you are interested in a smaller subset of the data to select specific tile names.
 
Breaklines These are the hydrological boundary lines that define streams, shorelines, and dams. These are a linear GIS feature that describes a change in the smoothness or continuity of a surface. These allow us to create Hydro –enforced Digital Terrain Models (DTM).

Illinois Waterflood Units 1946-2002,"The Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS) has collected data regarding injected and produced fluids of oil payzones for over 2000 waterflood projects in Illinois. These data are not collected by any other organization and are available only at the ISGS. These data were compiled to create a comprehensive data layer that delineates boundaries of all known waterflood projects currently operating and that have operated in the past in Illinois. Outlines of individual waterflood projects were compiled from historic hand-drawn maps (1:31680) by ISGS geologists or maps (scales vary) submitted by operators. These maps were scanned and georeferenced. Waterflood projects were then digitized. Information about each waterflood project is contained in a waterflood database completed in conjunction with this data layer. Some information from the waterflood database is related as attributes. As waterflood boundaries may change over time, only a portion of a waterflood throughout its history may be digitally represented. This data layer was created as part of a U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Preferred Upstream Maintenance Pressure (PUMP) II initiative (DEFC26-02NT15132).
The data layer delineates boundaries of all known waterflood projects in Illinois in a digitial format. Waterflood information can then be used to distinguish areas that have been waterflooded from those that may not have been waterflooded. Areas not waterflooded or under-flooded can then be identified as underdeveloped areas (UDA's) which may have a high potential for economically feasible secondary oil recovery. Also, historic data is commonly used as analogs to evaluate potential of new floods.

Location Points from the ISGS Wells and Borings Database,"This dataset contains point locations from the ISGS Wells and Borings database. The attribute information includes API_NUMBER, STATUS (well or boring type code), STATUS_TEXT (verbose description of the well or boring type), COMP_DATE (the well completion date), LATITUDE, and LONGITUDE. The spatial reference is geographic coordinates, decimal degrees, NAD83. The data are exported to a shapefile weekly from the Wells and Borings (source) database for Internet distribution. The source database is updated daily. Thus, there may be recent updates (last 7 days) in the source database that are not reflected in this shapefile. The data are primarily oil, gas and water wells, but also include other designations such as engineering boring, stratigraphic test hole, injection well, etc. The collection contains data for over 580,000 wells and borings, some dating back to 1801 (assumed.) Most locations have not been field verified. The nominal scale is 1:62,500, however locations have been determined in several different ways at different scales. Most commonly, the location is derived by converting a legal (i.e. Public Land Survey Survey - PLSS) description to a point location. The stated accuracy is +/- 100 feet, however some points may be inaccurate by as much as one mile due to irregularities in the Illinois PLSS and associated descriptions. For legal descriptions that indicate only a PLSS section or quarter-section, the point is assumed to be in the center of the respective section or quarter-section.

Illinois Center Pivot Irrigation,"This coverage provides the locations and approximate farmed area under center pivot irrigation systems in use in Illinois during the 2012 and 2014 growing seasons. Center pivot irrigation imprints identifiable circular patterns on the landscape which can be visible in aerial images. The USDA collects aerial images during the crop growing season through the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) and makes them available through the USDA Geospatial Data Gateway. Images collected by the USDA during the 2012 and 2014 growing seasons were used to develop this coverage of center pivot irrigation areas. This was done by digitizing the area under each irrigation system using ArcGIS to plot the maps spatially, and creating a polygon for each individual system. The NAIP images were examined for irrigation patterns, and field boundaries were traced to create an ArcGIS map layer. In reviewing the USDA 2014 data, a QA/QC check indicated a few polygons were omitted from the original 2012 map. This revision includes the 2012 omitted systems and additional pivots identified from USDA images collected during the 2014 growing season. Using aerial photography to identify irrigation systems is limited by the resolution and timing of the photography, and in some cases a system may not have been discernable and may have been missed.
A total of 5,829 center pivot irrigation systems were identified in Illinois during the summer of 2012, representing approximately 553,000 acres of farmland. An additional 826 pivots were in use during the 2014 growing season, bringing the statewide total to 6,656 center pivot systems irrigating approximately 625,000 acres of farmland in 2014.

Currently, original negatives for these photographs have not been located. Due to this fact the original photographic prints are now the best substitute for the negatives. Use of the paper prints over time has resulted in their becoming faded, worn, defaced, or lost. Access to the print collection, currently available on this website, can be obtained through the US Army Corps of Engineers - Rock Island District(link is external) (the collection does not circulate).
Digitization, or print scanning, has been completed for a Pools 11 through 19 of the Upper Mississippi River in an effort to create a lasting archive of this irreplaceable collection. Other images from other Pools may be added in the future if the remaining photos become available. The aerial photographs have not been georeferenced. Photographs that overlap can be used for stereoscopic viewing.


DataJPEG File Format
This format is a compressed file with the following file extension .jpg. The original TIFF format files were compressed using Adobe Photoshop CS4 and their Quality setting was set to 10. The average file size is approximately 9.0 megabytes for each 7x9 inch photos. These files should open in most browsers as they are an open source file format. These files have not been georeferenced.
MrSID File Format
This format is a compressed digital file with the following file extension .sid. The original TIFF format files were compressed using LizardTech's GeoExpress software in Generation 2 .sid file format at a target compression ratio of 6:1. The resulting average file size is 6.25 megabytes for each 7x9 inch photos. These files require a special viewer (ExpressView browser plug-in, available below) in order to view them online. They will also open in some mapping software (despite not being georeferenced) once they have been downloaded. The ExpressView browser plug-in is not available for Macintosh OS X or higher and is getting increasingly difficult to find for Mac OS versions earlier than OS X. The plugin does not work with Google Chrome. These files have not been georeferenced.
TIFF File Format
This format is a full resolution file format with the following file extension .tif. These are the original uncompresed files. They were scanned at 750dpi on a Crosfield Drum scanner. The average file size is approximately 37.0 megabytes for each 7x9 inch photos. These files require a browser plugin to be viewed online. Many software programs will be able to view the images once they are downloaded. These files have not been georeferenced.

Individual prints are organized by exposure number and grouped by navigational pools. The flight path follows the Mississippi River (downstream and upstream). The photos will all be displayed with the exposure number in the lower right corner. This does not mean that north is always at the top of the digital image. Since the flight path follows the path of the river each individual photo will need to be rotated to match the area of the river they are representing. Some photos may need to be rotated up to 180 degrees.
Links for each scanned print are displayed by exposure number. Prints that were missing from the collection are listed but do not have a link associated with them.
An index to the prints is available via this document.
Metadata:* Metadata will be available soon. 
Resources:ExpressView Browser Plugin(link is external) from LizardTech allows you to view .sid files. 
File Naming Conventions
Each photograph has an exposure number labebled on the photo. Naming conventions for the digital files include a code for the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) and an exposure number; zeros are used as placeholders.
Example: The file named UMR0405.sid is labeled 405 on the photograph.
Code:
UMR
= Upper Mississippi River
Exposure Number:
0405
= Exposure 405

1937-1947 Illinois Historical Aerial Photography,"Statewide aerial photographs were first acquired for Illinois from 1937 through 1947. This collection history gives details about the approximately 33,500 photographic paper prints that were scanned. The original silver nitrate film negatives were purposefully destroyed by the National Archives in the early 1980s due to deterioration and instability. An attempt to copy the negatives prior to their destruction resulted in a very poor quality replacement. Due to this fact the original photographic prints are now the best substitute for the negatives. Use of the paper prints over time has resulted in their becoming faded, worn, defaced, or lost. Access to these print collections is becoming increasingly restricted.

2005 Illinois NAIP Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle Data,"Abstract
This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders.

This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs.

2011 Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) Orthophotography,"The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) coordinated the funding and acquisition of the 2011 digital orhtophotography for 95 counties in Illinois. The metropolitan Chicago area including Cook, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, Lake, McHenry and Will counties were not acquired as part of this IDOT project. The native projection for the 2011 IDOT orthophotography is transverse Mercator, Illinois State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS), West and East zones, NAD 1983 datum.
For the purposes of data delivery and distribution, the orthophotography is organized into data tiles, each covering a geographic area of 10,000 ft. x 10,000 ft. The ground spatial resolution of each orthophoto tile is 1 ft. x 1 ft. per pixel for 93 of the 95 Illinois counties. Because of a county cost-sharing option made available as part of the 2011 IDOT orthophotography project, higher resolution orthophotography with a ground spatial resolution 0.5 ft. x 0.5 ft. was processed and is available for Sangamon and Tazewell Counties, as well as a portion of Woodford County. Each data tile was created utilizing multiple aerial images. The metadata for each tile will show the date the imagery was captured.
Images were captured between March 16th and May 30th, 2011, using a Z/I Imaging Digital Mapping Camera (DMC). The DMC system collects imagery in four spectral bands, and therefore users can select between either a natural color rendition (RGB = 1,2,3) or near-infrared rendition (RGB = 4,1,2) for a particular application:
Band 1 = Red (598-675 nm)
Band 2 = Green (500-650 nm)
Band 3 = Blue (400-580 nm)
Band 4 = Near-IR (675-850 nm)",https://clearinghouse.isgs.illinois.edu/viewers/AerialTileViewer.html,"DataSummaryThe Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) coordinated the funding and acquisition of the 2011 digital orhtophotography for 95 counties in Illinois.

DataUncompressed Data
Full Resolution data will be available for download as a Zip file bundle. Each Zip file will include a GeoTIFF (tif) file, a georeferencing world file (tfw), and metadata (xml). Average file size of each GeoTIFF file is 381 MB before Zip bundling. Lossless compression was used in the Zip bundling of these files and the final Zip files will vary in size.
A statewide collection, excluding the 7 Chicago Metropolitan Area counties, of full resolution data requires about 7.3 Terabytes of storage space.
Compressed Data
Compressed data are available via a Zip file bundle. Each Zip includes a compressed image (Jpeg 2000) and a metadata file (xml). Jpeg 2000 (jp2) files were created from the full resolution GeoTIFFs using LizardTech's GeoExpress 7. Target compression ratio was 15:1; one compressed file is roughly 25 megabytes in size. No added compression (including lossless compression) was used in the zip bundling of these files.
A statewide collection, excluding the 7 Chicago Metropolitan Area counties, of compressed data requires 500 Gigabytes of storage space.
IDOT 2011 compressed data are now available free-of-charge via:
Countywide Collections - 63 SPCS East zone County Zip files & 68 SPCS West zone county Zip files 
    note - 34 counties overlap the SPCS East/West zone boundary 
Available Soon- an interactive map for data download and viewing of individual tiles [6,695 tiles in SPCS East zone & 10,381 tiles in SPCS West zone]

Compressed Countywide Collections

Each county Zip file bundle consists of a set of Jpeg 2000 (jp2) files and associated metadata (xml) files representing the data tiles found in that projection of the county. Each county has a buffer of tiles around it to ensure full county coverage. Thirty-four Illinois counties are situated along the Illinois State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS), West and East zone boundary. These counties contain data tiles that are available in both projections along the boundary area of that county. The Zip files that contain the partial counties along the SPCS East/West zone boundary are noted with a ""p"" in front of their name and are highlighted in the table below.
Countywide compressed .zip file bundles contain:
<filename>.jp2 - multiple JPEG 2000 compressed images from entire county
<filename>.xml - multiple metadata files for uncompressed GeoTIFF image, edited to include compressed image information for entire county

Notes:
Zip files are large in size; some may take several hours to download. Make certain your Internet provider does not have a 2GB cap or time limit on file downloads. Also, if you can download the Zip file but run into errors with extraction, you might be using a program that only extracts 32-bit Zip files. You will need to use a program called 7-Zip, or a similar program, that can handle 64-bit Zip files. Submit a Help Request Form to receive any county by mail.
Caution:
The native projection for the 2011 IDOT orthophotography is transverse Mercator, Illinois State Plane Coordinate System (SPCS), West and East zones, NAD 1983 datum. Users should be aware that re-projection of the data into another map projection can result in horizontal displacements of the imagery from their original location.

2011 Illinois NAIP Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle Data,"Abstract
This data set contains imagery from the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). The NAIP program is administered by USDA FSA and has been established to support two main FSA strategic goals centered on agricultural production. These are increase stewardship of America's natural resources while enhancing the environment, and to ensure commodities are procured and distributed effectively and efficiently to increase food security. The NAIP program supports these goals by acquiring and providing ortho imagery that has been collected during the agricultural growing season in the U.S. The NAIP ortho imagery is tailored to meet FSA requirements and is a fundamental tool used to support FSA farm and conservation programs. Ortho imagery provides an effective, intuitive means of communication about farm program administration between FSA and stakeholders. New technology and innovation is identified by fostering and maintaining a relationship with vendors and government partners, and by keeping pace with the broader geospatial community. As a result of these efforts the NAIP program provides three main products: DOQQ tiles, Compressed County Mosaics (CCM), and Seamline shape files. The Contract specifications for NAIP imagery have changed over time reflecting agency requirements and improving technologies. These changes include image resolution, horizontal accuracy, coverage area, and number of bands. In general, flying seasons are established by FSA and are targeted for peak crop growing conditions. The NAIP acquisition cycle is based on a minimum 3 year update of base ortho imagery. The tiling format of the NAIP imagery is based on a 3.75' x 3.75' quarter quadrangle with a 300 pixel buffer on all four sides. NAIP quarter quads are formatted to the UTM coordinate system using the North American Datum of 1983. NAIP imagery may contain as much as 10% cloud cover per tile.
Purpose
NAIP imagery is available for distribution within 60 days of the end of a flying season and is intended to provide current information of agricultural conditions in support of USDA farm programs. For USDA Farm Service Agency, the 1 meter and 1/2 meter GSD product provides an ortho image base for Common Land Unit boundaries and other data sets. The 1 meter and 1/2 meter NAIP imagery is generally acquired in projects covering full states in cooperation with state government and other federal agencies that use the imagery for a variety of purposes including land use planning and natural resource assessment. The NAIP is also used for disaster response.",/viewers/ImageService.html,"DataSummaryAbstract

DataPurpose
Vegetation acts as an integrator of many physical and biological properties of an area. IL-GAP characterizes the extent and distribution of existing vegetated cover in Illinois for the following objectives: determination of species and natural community representation within areas being managed for biodiversity conservation, to provide geospatial data that can be used to model wildlife habitat distributions, and development of a single temporal data set for monitoring trends.
Land Cover Mapping
A detailed Gap Analysis classification of the vegetated areas of the state has been completed using the same methodology as for the Land Cover Data for Illinois 1999-2000, also referred to as the Illinois Interagency Classification Project (IILCP). There is one notable exception of methodological differences in forested and urbanized areas of northeastern Illinois. Within each of the ten Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) satellite Path/Row scene areas that comprise the state, the initial classification of forested lands accomplished in the IILCP were used as masks to segregate all forested areas for further analysis.
The same Landsat TM triplicate imagery used for the IILCP classification was used for the IL-GAP forested lands classification analysis. An additional channel vector, referred to as a Slope-Aspect-Index (SAI), was added to the TM multispectral channel data prior to the classification procedures. The SAI was produced using a statewide composite of U.S. Geological Survey 1-arc second Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data. The SAI combines the measurements of slope and aspect into a unique scalar value, and was incorporated with the multispectral imagery to further refine the classification of forested lands, especially within areas of the state that exhibit dissected surface topography.
The forested lands were divided into Floodplain and Upland types, with each having three sub-categories. Swamp was also delineated. The ability to detect differences between Floodplain and Upland forest was largely based on the DEM component. The sub-categorization of community level forest types was performed using soil surveys as ancillary data. These classification guidelines are taken from the Natural Areas Inventory of Illinois Technical Report (J. White and M. H. Madany 1978).
The IL-GAP urbanized land cover differs from the IILCP only in Landsat TM scene 2331 which contains Chicago. The presence of a highly urbanized city necessitated the classification of the urban landscape into finer levels. In TM Scene 2331 three density levels of urban were delineated (High, Medium, and Low) and retained in the IL-GAP land cover. In the IILCP the Medium and Low Density categories were combined. For a detailed description on how the urban areas were classified, see Challenges in Land Cover Classification in Areas of Rapid Urban Expansion.
The additional categories which have been identified with IL-GAP are denoted in red.

Illinois Landcover in the Early 1800s,"In Illinois, the surveys began in 1804 and were largely completed by 1843. The surveyors moved across the state laying out a rectangular grid system, known as the Public Land Survey System (PLS or PLSS). They were required to keep field notebooks where they noted details about their survey (such as which kind of tree was 'blazed' or marked at the section corners), as well as notes about the quality of the landscape, mines, salt licks, watercourses, springs, mill seats and other 'remarkable and permanent things'. Once a township was finished, the surveyors were to make a map of the area. These surveys represent one of the earliest detailed maps for Illinois. They predate our county land ownership maps and atlases. These plat maps and field notebooks contain a wealth of information about what the landscape was like before the flood of settlers came into the state. Most of the over 1,700 townships in Illinois have at least one version of the original surveyor's map. Additional redrafted versions are also available for all townships. The redrafted versions were created in the 1850's at the regional GLO office in St. Louis, Missouri.

The redrafted versions were created in the 1850's at the regional GLO office in St. Louis, Missouri. Cartographers used the original maps in consultation with the field notebooks to create a more complete map of the township. It is these plat maps that the Illinois Natural History Survey used to create our Early 1800's land cover Land Cover map. 
The original GLO maps and field notes are housed in the Illinois State Archives in Springfield. Microfilm copies of the maps were made in the 1960's and distributed to several state university libraries and research centers across Illinois. We borrowed the set of microfilm housed in the Illinois State Geological Survey library. 
Each GLO map was scanned from the microfilm onto a laptop computer. We used Adobe Photoshop software and a Canon MS400 microfilm scanner to capture the images saving them as tiff files. The images were georectified, or spatially-referenced (using ERDAS Imagine software) against USGS Geological Survey Digital Raster Graphic (DRG) images (scanned USGS 7.5 minute topographic quadrangle maps) by matching the township and section corners on GLO images to the corresponding points on the DRG. This process allowed us to digitized or 'trace' the line work on the plat map using Geographic Information System (GIS) software (ESRI Arc/Info). 
Forty two different land cover categories and features from the plat maps were digitized. All land cover categories and feature names were the ones used by the surveyors or cartographers. The names of some features seemed to varied by area of the state (probably by surveyor) and were combined. These included bluff/sand bluff, barrens/open barrens, bottoms/bottom land, field/enclosure, hills/sandy hills, high ridge/sandy ridge, island/sandy island, mound/high mound, river/wide river, ravine/gully,valley/hollow, sandy prairie/sandy ground, timber/forest/grove/wooded. Towns and roads or trails were not digitized. The attribute table item “Land_Code” has all 42 land cover categories.  The attribute table item “Map” has the 12 land cover categories as displayed on the poster.
The scanned, georectified images of each township are now a permanent archive of the GLO maps. This will allow users to view the original plat maps. The separate digitized version of the plat maps is a statewide GIS coverage, which can be used on its own or as a layer in GIS analysis. 
Five revisions of the data have been released. One correction was in the NW corner of present day Peoria County. The scanned township on the microfilm was mislabeled. The correct township was obtained and data was corrected. A second error was discovered in present day Adams county. A prairie area was mis-digitized and incorrectly labeled as forest. The missing lines were added and the labels were corrected. The third error set of errors included Massac and Lawrence counties. In Massac county, a pond was mis-labeled as a prairie. The label was corrected. In Lawrence county, along the Wabash river, stray lines were removed and ridge lines were added in the forest area. The forth-fifth set of errors included JoDaviess, Carroll and Stephenson counties. In JoDaviess county, a forest area was mis-labeled as prairie. The label was corrected. In Carrol county, a line between forest and prairie was missing. This line was added and incorrect lines were deleted. A prairie label was added to the resulting polygon. An adjacent forest larea was mis-labeled as prairie. This was corrected. In Stephenson county, several lines were removed. One line was added and several labels mis-identified as prairie were corrected to forest. The sixth set of corrections were made in Lake county. A color version of the plat maps were obtained and georeferenced, providing a clearer view of lines and labels. The primary changes were to ponds, streams, wetlands and bottomlands which were added or modified. 
This two-year effort was partially funded by Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Office of Realty and Environmental Planning.

DataData files are offered as original USGS DRG .tif files. One uncompressed file is roughly 4 megabytes in size.
A statewide collection of 1:24,000 scale quadrangle data requires about 2.6 Gigabytes of storage space. We do not plan to distribute uncompressed data files by any other means (cd-rom, zip drives, portable drives, ftp download, etc).
USGS DRG data for Illinois are available free-of-charge via:
an interactive map,
a list of 1:24,000 scale quadrangles (1,071 files) for data download,
a list of 1:100,000 scale quadrangles (51 files) for data download, and
a list of 1:250,000 scale quadrangles (17 files) for data download. 
    Uncompressed .zip file bundles contain:
README.txt - a text copy of this file listing,
<filename>.tif - TIFF image,
<filename>.tfw - Companion Georeferencing file,
<filename>.fgd - The original USGS metadata, and
<filename>.updated.met - IDNR modified metadata. 
Metadata:
Sample original USGS 1:24,000 quadrangle metadata for UTM data by zone.
Sample original USGS 1:100,000 quadrangle metadata for UTM data by zone.
Sample original USGS 1:250,000 quadrangle metadata for UTM data by zone. 
Note: the USGS changed the name of the 1:24,000 Eaton Quadrangle to Porterville. 
File index:
The USGS Topographic Map Index (5.2 MB) can assist you in locating a 1:24,000 scale quadrangle. 
1:100,000 and 1:250,000 scale quadrangles are in tables that approximate the shape of Illinois.
